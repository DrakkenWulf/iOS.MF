iOS.MF
==============

An iOS optimised theme for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

This is a very lightweight theme with only a limited set of pages available and theming applied, but which provides a good user experience for interacting with a the core functionality of SMF.

This has been used with various versions of SMF from 2.0 RC3 through to SMF 2.0.7, but has not been tested with all of them.
