iOS7-SMF-Theme
==============

An iOS 7 forum theme for use with SMF on mobile devices.

This is a very lightweight theme with only a limited set of pages available and theming applied, but which provides a good user experience for interacting with a the core functionality of SMF.

This has been used with various versions of SMF from 2.0 RC3 through to SMF 2.0.7, but has not been tested with all of them.

This theme is based on the excellent SMF4iPhone by Fabius, butchs and FarFromPerfection: http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?lemma=2089.

The theme uses the Adk Skype Emoticons to give crisp retina smileys (licence: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

Internally we use the jQuery, Hammer.js, Touchy and jQuery Autosize libraries.
