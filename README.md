iOS.MF
==============

A Simple Machines Forum, iOS optimised theme for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

This is a very lightweight theme which provides a great user experience when interacting with the core functionality of SMF on mobile devices.

This has been used with various versions of SMF from 2.0 RC3 through to SMF 2.0.8, but has not been tested with all of them.

Settings and admin pages should be accessed via the default user theme.
