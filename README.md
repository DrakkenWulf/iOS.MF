iOS7-SMF-Theme
==============

An iOS 7 forum theme for use with SMF on mobile devices.

Initially branched from the SMF4iPhone theme by Fabius85 (which is based on SMF 4 iPhone by FarFromPerfection) and worked on and used privately for a number of years.

This is a very lightweight theme with only a limited set of pages available and theming applied, but which provides a good user experience for interacting with a the core functionality of SMF.

This has been used with various versions of SMF from 2.0 RC3 through to SMF 2.0.7, but has not been tested with all of them.
