iOS.MF
==============

An iOS optimised theme for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

This is a very lightweight theme with only a limited set of pages available and theming applied, but which provides a good user experience for interacting with a the core functionality of SMF.

This has been used with various versions of SMF from 2.0 RC3 through to SMF 2.0.7, but has not been tested with all of them.

To-Do
==============

- [ ] Sort out smilies directory
- [ ] Newest post first - default in member options (add this) or notice in readme
- [ ] Press and hold to go to first/last post/page - create generic control
- [ ] Style subscription and registration templates
- [ ] Fix guest posting
- [ ] Fix posts still highlight when quoting is off or the user is a guest and can't post
- [ ] Double check that all paging works (I think I had to hack other parts of SMF to get consistent paging details under RC3)
- [ ] Style personal messages template and add link on menu
- [ ] Look for an alternative to the taskbar (this doesn't work amazingly with mobile Safari). This should have links to home, unread, inbox, profile (maybe), and search (maybe, depending on how it works).
- [ ] Add retina version of a new default user image

Installation
==============

Install the theme by uploading the iOS.MF_theme_v1.zip file through the SMF Administration Center > Configuration > Themes and Layout > Manage and Install > From a file.

It is recommended that you use this theme with the "Show most recent posts at the top" option on.
