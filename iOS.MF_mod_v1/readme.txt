[size=2em][b][u]iOS.MF - Theme Functions[/u][/b][/size]

This modification adds extra functions which are optional for the iOS.MF theme.

These functions enable the theme to extend the default SMF behaviour in a number of small ways and are only used in conjunction with iOS.MF.

At present this modification enables the following functionality within the theme:

 - A drop down list of forum users when composing personal messages
 - A count of the unread topics displayed as a badge on the toolbar
 - When viewing personal messages as a conversation or one at a time, only mark messages as read once they have been opened, rather than viewed in the top level menu
